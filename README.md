### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I spent too much time trying to figure out why my poster images weren't loaded but it was simply a mistyped URL. 
- Overall I have enjoyed learning the new concepts and Swift syntax. It is a bit challenging to understand the ? and ! differences but I'll read up on it more. 
- It was difficult to add my app to my phone since I had to add my Apple ID as personal development team and then trust profile in phone. Ended up working though!
