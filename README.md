### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- The walkthrough was straightforward and I did not encouter too many challenges.
- I spent too much time trying to figure out why my poster images weren't loaded but it was simply a mistyped URL. 
- Overall I have enjoyed learning the new concepts and Swift syntax. It is a bit challenging to understand the ? and ! differences but I'll read up on it more.
